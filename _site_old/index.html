<h3 id="miriam-zisook-founder-and-director">Miriam Zisook, founder and director</h3>

<p><img class="headshot" src="images/headshot-miriam.jpeg" alt="photo of a smiling white woman with dark hair and a short haircut" title="Miriam Zisook" /></p>

<p>As a <a href="http://miriamzisook.com/projects">designer</a> and social worker, I have spent the past decade working toward inclusion and empowerment of disabled and marginalized people. Across the projects I worked on as a designer and researcher, I was drawn to participatory design strategies that engaged the users and audiences of products in their design process. Inviting a wide range of humans—including engineers, doctors, patients, students, and teachers—into the design process was powerful and transforming.</p>

<p>At the same time, I was recovering from the perfectionism and grind of art school by rebuilding my own relationship with making and craft, and beginning a journey of healing my relationship with my body by making my own clothes. Through these explorations, I came to the idea that my design skills might be most powerful not for making <em>things,</em> but as tools to help people experience the same sense of agency and healing I was developing by making. I followed that instinct through the process of becoming a social worker and therapist.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.miriamzisook.com/resume/">As a social worker, I have provided mental health counseling, coaching and support groups in schools and outpatient mental health</a>. As a therapist, I bring the designer's skills of problem definition, thoughtful standard setting, creativity and resourcefulness to the challenge of individual and collective wellbeing.</p>

<p>Unstoppable Studios was born out of a desire to further explore the intersections of design, craft, emotional wellbeing and relationships and to invite others into those explorations with me.</p>
