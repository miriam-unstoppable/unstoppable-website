<p>In this program, a small group of participants will meet together to explore their relationships with their bodies and clothes by sewing and fitting their own garments. The program brings together supportive conversation around body image healing with practical sewing skills for building a wardrobe that fits your body as it truly is.</p>

<p>Participants will conceptualize, source materials for, and make a clothing item that they can wear with comfort, confidence, and joy. They will also engage with texts and discussion questions designed to help people understand and share their personal relationships to their body in the context of diet culture and fatphobia. The group will also learn garment fitting techniques specific for fitting larger, curvier and/or gender non-conforming bodies.</p>

<p>This program is most appropriate for folks who have at least some garment sewing experience, but it is also open to brave beginners. You should be able to thread and operate your machine, have an idea of what “seam finishing” means, and feel confident enough to do some independent sewing outside of class time.</p>
