<p>We design and offer small group opportunities for kids to come together and work on problem solving, creativity, and collaboration for a variety of contexts and settings. Here are some examples of programs that Miriam has offered in the past. If you're interested in bringing something like this to children in your life, reach out <a href="contact.html">here</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sensory Science at ASPIRE day camp.</strong> In this program, kids experimented with hands on projects that helped them develop self-awareness of their sensory preferences and needs. Projects included making slime, making scented lotions, and creating fidget toys. We also built a camp-wide frog habitat, but that part wasn't planned.</li>
  <li><strong>Maker Club at Perkins School for the Blind.</strong> The Maker Club ran for several years, and high school aged kids with multiple disabilities took on a wide variety of projects over time. From a collaborative sculpture of a hawk — Perkins' mascot — to technology take-aparts, to “design challenge” competitions, every project had multi-sensory and multi-ability modes of engagement. An all-time favorite was the annual egg drop competition, where students used recycled materials to build a device to safely land an egg from a balcony in the student center.</li>
  <li><strong>Science hour at the Manville School.</strong> In the science hour, elementary age students worked on projects designed to challenge their problem solving and confidence in a fun way. Students made slime (of course!), built catapults and kazoos out of popsicle sticks, and used chromatography to crack the case of a kidnapped class pet.</li>
</ul>
