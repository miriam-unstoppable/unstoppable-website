If you're seeking therapy, please know that right now I've got a waitlist, and I’m prioritizing people who specifically would benefit from my specialization: people who identify as neurodivergent or disabled, who are seeking a fat affirming provider, and/or who are seeking therapy that centers creative project doing. If that does not describe you, [this document](https://www.natalierusspsyd.com/resources-publications#h.py58wze376ix) offers guidance on how to continue to search for therapy. 

If you wish to meet in person, more information about the office can be found <a href="https://unstoppable-studio.notion.site/Office-Visitor-Information-2bd87452884b467aae48bc28af7f52cf?pvs=4">here</a>.
