# About 
### Unstoppable Studios is a maker space for making the world fit us and not the other way around.

Our collaborative creative workspace✳︎ supports makers of all experience and ability levels as they fearlessly imagine, prototype, create, and collaborate to make things together. By cultivating the relationships and skills to make what we need to thrive, we move together towards an empowered, inclusive, interconnected future.

You can read more about the [vision](vision.html) that grounds our mission and [our plans for the future](future.html) here.

✳︎We're still working on the workspace part. For now, we offer [creative groups](),[therapy and coaching]() online and in a variety of community spaces.

## Our Unstoppable Team

### Miriam Zisook, founder and director

<img class="headshot" src="images/headshot-miriam.jpeg" alt="photo of a smiling white woman with dark hair and a short haircut" title="Miriam Zisook"/>

As a [designer](http://miriamzisook.com/projects) and social worker, I have spent the past decade working toward inclusion and empowerment of disabled and marginalized people. Across the projects I worked on as a designer and researcher, I was drawn to participatory design strategies that engaged the users and audiences of products in their design process. Inviting a wide range of humans&#8212;including engineers, doctors, patients, students, and teachers&#8212;into the design process was powerful and transforming. 

At the same time, I was recovering from the perfectionism and grind of art school by rebuilding my own relationship with making and craft, and beginning a journey of healing my relationship with my body by making my own clothes. Through these explorations, I came to the idea that my design skills might be most powerful not for making *things,* but as tools to help people experience the same sense of agency and healing I was developing by making. I followed that instinct through the process of becoming a social worker and therapist. 

[As a social worker, I have provided mental health counseling, coaching and support groups in schools and outpatient mental health](http://www.miriamzisook.com/resume/). As a therapist, I bring the designer&#39;s skills of problem definition, thoughtful standard setting, creativity and resourcefulness to the challenge of individual and collective wellbeing.

Unstoppable Studios was born out of a desire to further explore the intersections of design, craft, emotional wellbeing and relationships and to invite others into those explorations with me.
