We design and offer small group opportunities for kids to come together and work on problem solving, creativity, and collaboration for a variety of contexts and settings. Here are some examples of programs that Miriam has offered in the past. If you&#39;re interested in bringing something like this to children in your life, reach out [here](contact.html). 

- **Sensory Science at ASPIRE day camp.** In this program, kids experimented with hands on projects that helped them develop self-awareness of their sensory preferences and needs. Projects included making slime, making scented lotions, and creating fidget toys. We also built a camp-wide frog habitat, but that part wasn&#39;t planned.
- **Maker Club at Perkins School for the Blind.** The Maker Club ran for several years, and high school aged kids with multiple disabilities took on a wide variety of projects over time. From a collaborative sculpture of a hawk — Perkins&#39; mascot — to technology take-aparts, to "design challenge" competitions, every project had multi-sensory and multi-ability modes of engagement. An all-time favorite was the annual egg drop competition, where students used recycled materials to build a device to safely land an egg from a balcony in the student center.
- **Science hour at the Manville School.** In the science hour, elementary age students worked on projects designed to challenge their problem solving and confidence in a fun way. Students made slime (of course!), built catapults and kazoos out of popsicle sticks, and used chromatography to crack the case of a kidnapped class pet.
