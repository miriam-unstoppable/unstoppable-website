Project: Project is a coaching group for folks with executive dysfunction taking on a personal, professional, or creative project. The group meets weekly to provide structure, accountability, and scaffolding. During meetings, participants share progress, give and receive feedback to help each other move toward their goals, share resources and ideas to support improved executive functioning, set weekly goals for progress between sessions, and, most importantly, celebrate the big and small wins along the way.
