For folks who have estranged or especially strained family ties, heirlooms can be a symbol of loss and brokenness, or they might not exist at all. In this small group program, participants will come together to explore their family stories and create an heirloom that reflects their family as it truly is. That could mean processing an estrangement by reclaiming or altering an existing family heirloom, creating something new to reflect a chosen family, or cresting an artifact that tells their family story in a new way. 

Throughout the program, participants will be introduced to evocative and provocative storytelling and art-making about family, have opportunities to share and explore their family stories, and conceptualize, design, and create a project that they can cherish.
