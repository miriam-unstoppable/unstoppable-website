In this program, participants will make projects as a way to help manage anxiety and resist perfectionism. Participants work with the facilitator to explore their anxiety, how it functions in their life, and how they&#39;d prefer it to function instead. They have support to come up with an idea and set goals for what they want to accomplish within the 14&#8211;week program. Participants will meet weekly to build and test prototypes, give and receive feedback and support, and eventually document and share their projects.  

Participants can work toward resisting the effects of anxiety in several ways. They might make things that help manage anxiety, like a sensory item or mood tracking tool. They might explore and express the anxiety through stories, creating a project like a comic or blog. Or, they might pursue projects in any other form&#8212;including technology, card games, clothing, comics, jewelry&#8212;in an intentional encounter with and exploration of new ways of relating to anxiety and perfectionism.  

Participants will have support and guidance in picking projects to work on and defining standards of success that will allow them to finish the project in 14 weeks. This program is a great opportunity for adults who enjoy technology, design, and/or craft and want to build their problem solving and anxiety management skills.
